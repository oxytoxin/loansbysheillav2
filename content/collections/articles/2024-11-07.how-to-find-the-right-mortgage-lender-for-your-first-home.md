            text: " A mortgage lender is a financial institution that provides home loans, helping you finance your dream of homeownership. Lenders set the interest rate, determine loan terms, and approve or deny your application based on criteria like credit score, income, and debt-to-income ratio. They’re the entity you'll repay over the life of your loan, making it essential to choose a reliable and reputable lender."

Brokers can be helpful for those who want to compare multiple lenders without doing the research alone. However, brokers charge fees that can add to your closing costs. Conversely, a mortgage lender directly funds the loan, offering a simpler process with potentially lower fees.'
