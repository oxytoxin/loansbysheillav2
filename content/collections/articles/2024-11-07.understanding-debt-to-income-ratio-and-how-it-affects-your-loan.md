title: 'Understanding Debt-to-Income Ratio and How It Affects Your Loan'
author: 3
featured_image: articles/14.jpg
summary: 'Your debt-to-income ratio is a critical factor when applying for loans, as it reflects your capacity to handle additional debt. Lenders often prefer a DTI of 36% or lower for the best loan terms, though requirements vary by loan type. Understanding what is included in debt-to-income ratio and taking steps to improve it can help you secure a mortgage or other major loans. Use a debt-to-income ratio calculator to determine where you stand and create a plan to reduce your debt if necessary. For more on preparing for a mortgage, see our guide on preparing for a mortgage application, and explore NerdWallet’s mortgage insights for additional resources.'
