            text: 'An earnest money deposit is a sum paid by the buyer to show the seller that they are serious about purchasing the property. This deposit is typically 1-3% of the purchase price and is held until the deal closes. If all conditions are met, the deposit is applied toward the down payment or closing costs. However, failing to meet certain requirements can result in losing this deposit. Therefore, protecting it is crucial for any buyer.'
