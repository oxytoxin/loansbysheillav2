While the exact number may vary by lender, generally, you’ll need a score of 680 or higher to qualify for the best mortgage rates for second home purchases. A lower score will not necessarily disqualify you, but it will likely mean higher interest rates and potentially less favorable loan terms. Aiming for a score above 740 will open more doors to competitive rates.'

While DTI requirements can vary, most lenders prefer a DTI of 43% or lower for a second home. Some lenders might go up to 50% for borrowers with excellent credit, but a lower DTI is generally preferred. This indicates you're less likely to get overwhelmed by your financial obligations."

Loan amounts can range from the lowest amounts which typically start at $766,550 to over $1,000,000 for high-cost areas.'

The remaining 10% is your down payment. It is a strategy that can come with higher interest rates and requires more financial planning."
